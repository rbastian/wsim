# Pre-commit Hooks Setup

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run quality checks before commits.

## Installation

1. Install pre-commit:
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. Install the git hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
   ```

## What Gets Checked

### On Every Commit (pre-commit)
- **Backend:**
  - Ruff linting with auto-fix
  - Ruff formatting
  - Ty type checking
  - Frontend type checking (TypeScript)
  - Frontend linting (ESLint)

### On Push (pre-push)
- **Backend:**
  - Full pytest test suite

## Manual Run

You can manually run all hooks on all files:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Or run a specific hook:
```bash
pre-commit run ruff --all-files
pre-commit run ty-check --all-files
```

## Skipping Hooks (Not Recommended)

If you absolutely need to skip hooks:
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

Note: The CI pipeline will still run all checks, so skipping locally will just delay failures.

## Updating Hooks

To update pre-commit hooks to their latest versions:
```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```
