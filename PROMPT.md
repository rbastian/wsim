Your goal is to complete the UX redesign implementation of Wooden Ships and Iron Men (WSIM).

## MAIN LOOP
- Make sure you're on the main branch rebased from remote.
- Using the Beads issue tracking system, pick the most important non completed task and claim it. Then create a feature branch and implement it. Do not do any partitial implementations nor should you mock any implementations out. If you do this I'll yell at you. It' very *IMPORTANT* that you only do one thing at a time.
- If you discover any new work during your implementation, add sub-tasks to the bead. If you encounter bugs create new bug beads with appropriate priority but do not start work on them!
- Make sure that at the end of your implementation all tests are passing, that ruff formatting and linting pass and that the ty type checker reports no issues. We use the Astral tool-chain, so always remember to use uv - e.g. uv run ty check {files}.
- Commit your changes after any meaninful amount of work has been completed.
- Make sure you've updated the issue in Beads.
- Please write a short blurb on your implementation to progress.txt
- Open a PR for your changes and then merge it.
- If there are no ready beads left, please look for additional tests that can be written and then create a new bead for it.
