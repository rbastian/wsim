Your goal is to complete the MVP implementation of Wooden Ships and Iron Men (WSIM). WSIM is a turn based game of naval combat during the Age of Sail. In the game, players have a fleet or squadron or single ship. Players submit their orders and the orders for both player occur simultaneously.

Step #0 - Read the documentation in the /docs folder that contains the detailed product and technical requirements as well as the intial scenarios that need to be implemented.
Step #1 - Make sure you're on the main branch rebased from remote.
Step #2 - Using the Beads issue tracking system, pick the most important non completed task create a feature branch and implement it. Do not do any partitial implementations nor should you mock any implementations out. If you do this I'll yell at you. It' very *IMPORTANT* that you only do one thing at a time.
Step #3 - Make sure that at the end of your implementation all tests are passing, that ruff formatting and linting pass and that the ty type checker reports no issues. We use the Astral tool-chain, so always remember to use uv - e.g. uv run ty check {files}.
Step #4 - Commit your changes after any meaninful amount of work has been completed.
Step #5 - Make sure you've updated the issue in Beads.
Step #6 - Please write a short blurb on your implementation to progress.txt
Step #7 - Open a PR for your changes and then merge it.
