# WSIM UX Redesign Progress

## 2026-01-24: Full-Screen Hex Map Layout (wsim-5q8)

Implemented the foundation for the immersive UX redesign by restructuring GamePage.tsx:

**What Changed:**
- Removed all side panels (ShipLogPanel, OrdersPanel, CombatPanel, EventLog) from the visible layout
- Panels now hidden with `display: none` - preserved for future ShipActionPanel integration
- Created placeholder Top HUD (80px height) with:
  - Parchment aesthetic (rgba(242, 235, 220, 0.98) gradient)
  - Decorative top border with player colors
  - Turn number and phase badge with color coding
  - Wind direction display
- Converted hex map to full-screen:
  - Fills viewport minus 80px HUD height
  - Ocean gradient background (radial #1a4d5c to #0d2d3a)
  - Subtle wave texture overlay at 10% opacity
  - Centered, scrollable container with 2rem padding

**HexGrid Updates:**
- Removed dark background, now transparent
- Updated hex stroke to nautical cream/tan (#d4c5a9) at 30% opacity
- Phase-specific colors:
  - Combat arcs: red (#a74a4a) with 20% fill
  - Path preview: blue (#4a7ba7) with 30% fill
- Hover interaction: opacity increases to 60%
- Coordinate labels now use faded ink color (#8b7d6b)

**Technical Details:**
- All TypeScript type checking passes
- ESLint passes (2 pre-existing warnings in unmodified CombatPanel)
- Build succeeds (273KB gzipped bundle)
- No breaking changes to props or data flow

**Next Steps:**
This bead establishes the layout foundation. The following beads are now unblocked:
- wsim-37z: Create proper TopHUD component with WindRose
- wsim-xr1: Implement ShipActionPanel with slide-in animation
- wsim-cd6: Add ship visual state indicators (ready, struck, fouled)

The full-screen ocean battlefield is now in place, ready for the detailed HUD and panel components.
