# WSIM Development Progress

## 2026-01-19

### Backend Setup (wsim-n6i) - COMPLETED
Initialized the Python backend project with a complete development environment:

**Infrastructure:**
- Created project structure with `wsim_core` (pure rules engine) and `wsim_api` (FastAPI wrapper)
- Set up package directories: models, engine, tables, events, serialization, routers, deps
- Configured `uv` for package management with Python 3.12+

**Dependencies:**
- FastAPI 0.115+ with uvicorn for ASGI server
- Pydantic v2 for data validation and models
- pytest with coverage, hypothesis, and httpx for testing
- ruff for formatting and linting (line-length 100)
- ty for strict type checking

**Quality Assurance:**
- All code formatted with ruff (12 files checked)
- All linting checks pass
- Type checking passes with ty (strict mode)
- Test suite runs successfully (2/2 tests passing)

**API Foundation:**
- Basic FastAPI application with health endpoint
- CORS configured for local development (ports 3000 and 5173)
- OpenAPI documentation available at /docs
- Test client setup with httpx

**Next Steps:**
Ready to implement core Pydantic models (wsim-vbx) for game state representation.
