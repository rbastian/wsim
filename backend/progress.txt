Implemented the foundational Pydantic v2 models for the WSIM game engine:

### Models Created:
- **Common Enums**: Side, Facing (8 directions), WindDirection, LoadState, GamePhase, Broadside, AimPoint
- **HexCoord**: Hex coordinate model with hash support for use as dict keys
- **Ship**: Complete ship state including:
  - Identity (id, name, side)
  - Position (bow_hex, stern_hex, facing)
  - Movement stats (battle_sail_speed)
  - Combat stats (guns_L/R, carronades_L/R)
  - Tracks (hull, rigging, crew, marines)
  - Load state (load_L/R)
  - Status flags (fouled, struck)
  - Drift tracking (turns_without_bow_advance)
- **Orders**: ShipOrders and TurnOrders for movement planning phase
- **Events**: DiceRoll and EventLogEntry for comprehensive audit trail
- **Game**: Complete game state with ships dict, wind, phase, event log, and helper methods

### Test Coverage:
- Created 39 comprehensive tests covering all models
- Tests include validation, edge cases, and model interactions
- All tests passing

### Quality Checks:
- ✅ Ruff formatting and linting (all checks passed)
- ✅ Ty type checking (all checks passed)
- ✅ All pytest tests passing (39/39)

### Configuration:
- Added per-file linting exception for Ship model (_L/_R suffix is domain convention)
- Configured ty overrides for test files to handle dynamic dict unpacking

This provides the solid foundation for all other game engine components.
