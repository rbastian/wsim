### Movement Notation Rules:
- '0': No movement (can only appear alone)
- 'L': Turn left (60 degrees)
- 'R': Turn right (60 degrees)
- '1'-'9': Move forward that many hexes
- Combinations: 'L1R1' = turn left, move 1, turn right, move 1
- Case-insensitive with whitespace trimming

### Test Coverage:

## Implementation: Fouling System (wsim-8gn)
**Date:** 2026-01-19
**Issue:** wsim-8gn
**Status:** Completed

Implemented a comprehensive fouling system that integrates with the collision detection system. When ships collide, the system now automatically rolls for fouling and applies fouled status to ships based on the outcome.

**Key Features:**
- Fouling check uses 1d6 roll: 1-3 results in fouling, 4-6 avoids fouling
- Automatic fouling checks after every collision resolution
- Fouled status tracked in ship model (field already existed)
- Full event logging for all fouling checks with roll results and outcomes
- Seamless integration with existing collision detection system

**Implementation:**
- Created `wsim_core/engine/fouling.py` module (~130 lines)
  - `check_fouling()`: Rolls for fouling and creates event log entries
  - `apply_fouling()`: Applies fouled status to ships
  - `check_and_apply_fouling()`: Convenience function combining both
- Updated `wsim_core/engine/collision.py`:
  - Modified `detect_and_resolve_collisions()` to call fouling checks after each collision
  - Added fouling event import and integration
- Updated `wsim_core/engine/__init__.py` to export fouling functions
- Updated existing collision tests to expect additional fouling events

**Testing:**
- Created comprehensive test suite: `tests/engine/test_fouling.py` with 15 tests
- Test coverage includes:
  - Fouling checks with various roll outcomes
  - Single ship (no fouling), two ships, multiple ships
  - Apply fouling to already-fouled ships
  - Partial ship ID handling
  - Event logging validation
  - Deterministic behavior with seeded RNG
  - State preservation (other ship properties unchanged)
- Updated 2 existing collision tests to account for fouling events
- All 167 tests pass

**Quality Checks:**
- ruff formatting: clean (2 files reformatted)
- ruff linting: clean (1 import order fix applied)
- ty type checking (strict mode): clean
- Full integration with existing systems working correctly

**Design Decisions:**
- Simplified MVP fouling rules (50/50 chance with 1d6)
- Fouling always checked after collisions (no option to skip)
- Both ships involved in collision get fouled status if roll succeeds
- Fouling state persists on ships for future movement restrictions
- Event logging provides full transparency for debugging/replay

**Integration Points:**
- Collision detection system (automatic integration)
- RNG system (uses injected RNG for determinism)
- Event logging system (creates fouling_check events)
- Ship model (uses existing fouled field)

**Next Steps:**
Ready to implement next priority task from Beads backlog. Fouling system is complete and tested.

  - Applies crew casualties (hull hits only)
  - Applies gun damage proportionally to both broadsides (short range hull hits only)
  - Sets struck flag when hull reaches 0
  - Clamps all values to >= 0 (no negative tracks)

### Backend - API Endpoint (`wsim_api/routers/games.py`):
- **POST /games/{game_id}/turns/{turn}/combat/fire**
  - Request: ship_id, broadside (L/R), target_ship_id, aim (hull/rigging)
  - Validates game exists and turn matches
  - Validates phase is COMBAT
  - Validates firing ship can fire (not struck, broadside loaded, has guns)
  - Gets legal targets using closest-target rule
  - Validates requested target is legal with clear error message
  - Loads scenario to get initial crew for crew quality modifier
  - Resolves broadside fire using hit tables and RNG

  - **TestApplyDamage** (5 tests):
    - Hull damage application
    - Rigging damage application
    - Gun damage at short range
    - Hull reaching zero sets struck flag
    - Damage cannot go negative

- All 348 tests pass (17 new + 331 existing)

- ✅ ruff format: clean (1 file reformatted)
- ✅ ruff lint: clean (removed unused import, fixed exception chaining, renamed variables to lowercase)
- ✅ ty type checking: clean
- ✅ All pytest tests passing (348/348)

**Key Features:**
- **Closest-Target Rule Enforcement**: Game rules require firing at closest enemy in arc
